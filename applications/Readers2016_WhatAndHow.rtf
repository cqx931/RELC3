\i0  is a configurable sampler of three texts and selected quasi-autonomous, algorithmic Readers. Applications for Mac OS X, Windows and Unix allow human readers to shape and share reading experiences with various strategies and visual behaviors.

\b0\fs22 \cf0 If your cursor is positioned over the lowest register of the application, a set of labeled cycling buttons becomes visible. These are 'cycling' in the sense that successive mouse clicks will cycle through a short list of possible values. Hold down the shift key to cycle in the other direction, for example, typically, to return to a previous value.\
  The cursor in this position also reveals a reading 'monitor' positioned towards the bottom right. This displays, 'live,' the word that is currently at the center of the active Reader's attention.\

\b\fs28 \cf0  Reader  -\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl276\slmult1\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs22 \cf0 Three distinct types of Reader are implemented in 
\i Readers2016
\i0 . Further information on these readers and how they operate is available on 
\i The Readers Project
\i0  website.\
  The \'91Reader\'92 button allows you to cycle through the three types, with each type pre-configured by the authors of 
\i The Readers Project.
\i0  The options are:\
  Perigram [Reader]\
  Less Directed Perigram [Reader]\
  Simple Spawner\
  Perigram Spawner\
  Less Directed [Perigram] Spawner\
  Mesostic [Reader]\
\
All Readers are aware of their typographic neighborhood: the words that surround them on their 2D reading surfaces. Neighboring words are distinguished using directional terms relative to the current, central word being 'read.' The next word to be read in conventional order is said to be 'East' of the current, central word. In principle, a Reader may choose to shift its attention to any neighboring word, so delineated. In practice, most Readers pay more attention to words adjacent to the conventional vector of human reading: NE north-east and SE south-east.\
\
All readers in this selection are also provided with information concerning the relative frequencies of potential three-word phrases (3-grams) in their typographic neighborhoods. These we call these Perigrams.*\
\
The three main Reader types in 
\i Readers2016
\i0 :\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl276\slmult1\sb240\sa40\partightenfactor0

\b\fs24 \cf0 Perigram Reader\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl276\slmult1\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs22 \cf0 A Perigram Reader determines its direction of reading \'96\'a0or the next word to which it will shift its attention \'96\'a0by assessing whether on not a word in its typographic neighborhood completes a relatively frequent Perigram (see above). A Perigram reader is, in a sense, like a 3-gram Markov chain text generator that remains tethered to its typographic locale.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl276\slmult1\sb240\sa40\partightenfactor0

\b\fs24 \cf0 Spawner\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl276\slmult1\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs22 \cf0 A Spawner or Spawning Reader will shift its chief point of attention through the text in a number of different ways (see below), but it will also, by definition, spawn (in 
\i Readers2016
\i0 ) uni-directional Perigram Readers in either a north-eastern or a south-eastern direction, or both. In principle any kind of Reader might spawn Readers with their own characteristics and behaviors, including other Spawning Readers.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl276\slmult1\sb240\sa40\partightenfactor0

\b\fs24 \cf0 Mesostic Reader\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl276\slmult1\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs22 \cf0 The Mesostic Reader is quite different. It is pre-seeded with a piece of language that it must spell out by finding, in succession, words within the text that it is reading which contain the letters of its seed. This Reader endlessly loops around this task of spelling. For 'Poetic Caption' the seed text is 'READING AS WRITING THROUGH', for 'Misspelt Landings' the text is 'REACHING OUT FALLING THROUGH CIRCLING OVER LANDING ON TURNING WITHIN SPELLING AS' and for 'The Image' it is 'COMES IN IS OVER GOES OUT IS DONE LOLLS IN STAYS THERE IS HAD NO MORE.'\
  Mesostic Readers also have relative frequency information concerning the Perigrams of the text that they are reading. They look for the nearest next word that allows them to spell their seed phrases, but they prefer to find words that complete a relative frequent Perigram.\
\
Now, to expand on the options actually implemented for 
\i Readers2016 
\i0 : \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl276\slmult1\sb220\sa40\partightenfactor0

\b \cf0 Perigram [Reader]\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl276\slmult1\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf0 The Perigram Reader, as configured for 
\i The Readers Project
\i0  and 
\i Readers2016
\i0  is one that determines whether on not to shift its attention from a conventional reading order depending on whether on not it finds relatively frequent completions of three-word Perigrams in, especially, its north-eastern and, more especially, its south-eastern neighbors. The attention of this Reader wanders but tends to proceed in a conventional overall direction, weighted to the south-east.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl276\slmult1\sb220\sa40\partightenfactor0

\b \cf0 Less Directed Perigram Reader\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl276\slmult1\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf0 This Reader also only considers reading pathways where it may complete a relatively frequent Perigram, but its weightings allow it to shift attention upwards, downwards and even backwards with respect to the conventional path of human reading.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl276\slmult1\sb220\sa40\partightenfactor0

\b \cf0 Simple Spawner\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl276\slmult1\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf0 The reading path of this Reader is \'91simple\'92 or convential. It always moves its center of attention on to the next easterly word, but as it does do it will spawn readers in either or both south-eastern or north-eastern directions if these words complete a relatively frequent Perigram. The directions in which spawned Readers will be set off is determined by the value of the \'91Spawning\'92 button.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl276\slmult1\sb220\sa40\partightenfactor0

\b \cf0 Perigram Spawner\

These readers are only spawned if a word in the direction indicated completes a Perigram and they 'die' when then can no long find a Perigram completion in their direction of reading.\
